# Secure Password Generator — Tutorial Project

This is a simple Python tutorial project that teaches you how to generate secure passwords using the `secrets` and `string` libraries from Python’s standard library.

Perfect for beginners who want to understand:

- How to use random secure generators
- Conditional logic for validation
- Building a utility with customizable options

---

## What You'll Learn

- How to securely generate random strings in Python
- Using the `secrets` module for cryptographic security
- Building flexible functions with optional parameters
- Validating user-defined password rules (length, character types)

---

## How It Works

The main function is `make_secure_password()` which lets you customize:

- `length`: The length of the password (default is 32)
- `include_uppercase`: Whether to include uppercase letters
- `include_numbers`: Whether to include digits
- `include_symbols`: Whether to include punctuation symbols

The script keeps generating a password until it satisfies all enabled criteria.
